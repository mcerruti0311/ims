### Answers from Advanced Online (Can be used as a FAQ page).
**How will users track Progress of Orders: In Process, Packed, Shipped, Other?**  
All of our orders are produced and shipped out within 24 hours.  If the ship date is outside of the 24 hours, it will state on the confirmation page.  Should they want to see information about their order – they can use the reporting tools to find their order (with the confirmation number).  Tracking information for shipping is provided inside the ‘web portal’ reporting as well.

**How will the users be notified when an order is placed on back order or canceled?**  
The back order rate for us is very low, under .25%.  This should not be something that happens on a regular basis.  Should their order have back orders, our customer service team will contact the orderer directly informing them it’s on back order.  As well, it will update in the web portal reporting as to when it will be back in our facility and a new expected ship date.

Regarding this topic, our main suppliers we work with are considered just in time suppliers and are able to get us inventory within 1 day.  If we receive an order and we don’t have the inventory, our supplier gets us the inventory by 8am the next day in order to still produce an order

**How will the users receive confirmations on what was ordered?**  
Via email confirmations.  They can look up the orders at any time on the web portal also, with their confirmation number or email address.

**How will the users be notified when an item is discontinued?**  
When items are discontinued, our system automatically turns these products off so people cannot purchase these.  Nancy, the program manager, will be working closely with Hunter and Henry regarding the uniform store – should there be products being discontinued, she will notify them directly and figure out which product we want to replace it with.
Will the user be able to see status of all open orders they have placed?  Yes, they are able to look up all past and current orders.  Again, using their email address used for the orders or confirmation number they can find this.

**If an order is shipped to an employee other than who placed the order will the employee receive the same status updates?**  
Unfortunately, not at this time – it only allows one confirmation email.  However, the employee who has made the purchase, can forward the confirmation email directly to who is receiving it.  They can then look up the order through the web portal.  The employee making the purchase can use the receiving employee’s email to send the confirmation, if desired.

**Will the user be able to enter an order needed by date when they place an order?**
All of our orders are produced and shipped within 24 hours – so if the order is needed quicker than that we have a few options.  
1. We do have a comment field, however there is no specific ‘need by date’ for orders. The options orderers will have is to select overnight shipping to get it next day.  
1. The other option is if the purchaser is placing an order before 2pm CST, there is a same day ship option.  This means we will produce the order same day and have it shipped out that same day.  It is an additional $5 per order.   There are limitations to this, as in we cannot product 10,000 t-shirts in one day.  If this is the case, our customer service team will contact the purchaser directly to give them an update of the order status and new expected ship date.

**Will the user be able to specify a shipping address to an address other than a job location?**
 Yes, on every checkout they can update to a new address, any address desired.  Upon the first order with an email address, it is required to input an address.  All orders after that, it will auto populate that address, but can be changed at any time.

**Will the user be able to select a shipping address based on their job location?**  
Yes, this can be any ‘shippable’ address desired.  For your reference, we have the capability of UPS, FedEx, and USPS.  For the uniform store – we will be utilizing S.I.S.’s FedEx account.  For the employee store, we will be utilizing retail freight, so they will see USPS or FedEx rates.

**Will the user be able to select uniform options based on their job location?**  
Yes, as long as we have the correct information from your team, we will be able to only show specific uniforms for each client/job

**Will the user receive a tracking number for shipments?**
 Yes, this is tied to all confirmation numbers.  They can access this through the web portal reporting.
 
**Will the user be able to see on hand / available inventory?**
  All products shown on our portals are considered always available in whatever size they need, so we do not show on hand/available inventory.  Again, if it’s shown on our portal – it is considered in stock for any order.  We do have inventory reports available on the web portal available at any time and it is considered real-time reporting.  It can be everything up until the day before you are pulling reports.  It unfortunately does not calculate any orders placed the same day you are pulling the report, but is updated overnight daily.
