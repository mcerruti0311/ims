### Understand Key Principles Behind the Design System

#### Core Design Principles
* **Clarity** — Eliminate ambiguity. Enable people to see, understand, and act with confidence. The new UI has reduced clutter so that users can easily find the information they need.
* **Efficiency** — Streamline and optimize workflows. Intelligently anticipate needs to help people work better, smarter, and faster. For instance, the new Lightning UI buttons improve the prominence of calls to action.
* **Consistency** — Create familiarity and strengthen intuition by applying the same solution to the same problem. For example, the new UI enforces one button style across all contexts.
* **Beauty** — Demonstrate respect for people’s time and attention through thoughtful and elegant craftsmanship. Can a UI ever be beautiful? We think so!
