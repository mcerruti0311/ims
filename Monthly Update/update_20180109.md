## Inventory Management System App
### Inventory Management
#### Item and Item Details
##### Revision: 1.0
##### Revision Date: 1/9/2018
---
#### Purpose
The purpose of the Item (IMS) and Item Detail (IMS
Details) structure is to provide the foundation
for a "Normalized" database where data is not duplicated.  

Data should only be in the database once.  A relationship is created between the parent (IMS) record using the parent record id as the foreign key to the child record (IMS Details).

### IMS
|IMS Field | Description |
| ------- | -------- |
| Id | Primary Key |
| Description | 5.11 Tactical 71182 Shirt Polo  |

### IMS Details
|IMS Detail Field | Description |
| ------- | -------- |
| Id | Primary Key |
|IMS Id | Foreign Key |
|SKU | 8 Digit Auto Number |
|Size | Small |
| Detail Description (Item Description + Size) | 5.11 Tactical 71182 Shirt Polo - S  |

```
Note how the normalized database is structured.
The IMS record includes the base information.
This is information that doesn't change from
record to record.

The Detail record contains the information that
changes from record to record and is uniquely
identified by the SKU.  In this case the "Size"
is what changes.
```

### DATABASE STRUCTURE
* IMS (Item Master)
* IMS Details (Item Details)
* IMS Build (Customization)
* IMS Transactions (Transaction Parent)
* IMS Transaction (Transaction Child)

### Future Structure
* IMS Kits
* IMS Shipping
