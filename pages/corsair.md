*Corsair: When it appeared over the Pacific Ocean waters in 1943, the Corsair was the most powerful naval aviation aircraft. It was the first U.S. single-engine fighter to exceed 400 m.p.h. Remembered for its “W”-shaped wings, it became feared by the Japanese Zero’s pilots – in the Pacific theatre alone, in the course of some 64,000 missions, Corsairs downed 2,140 enemy planes while only 189 Corsairs were lost, a ratio unmatched in the history of air warfare.*
